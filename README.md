Sculpting is one of my favorite passtimes. My favorite clay is sculpey clay, as it is malleable, colorful and iconic. I like to use the colored clay, rather than paint over it, for a more cartoon-like finish.
# <span style="color:red"> Why i enjoy sculpting
1. its cooler than 2D art
2. you can actually use your creations
3. its meditative
